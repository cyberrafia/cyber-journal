## 🧠 What I Learned in My First Class

In my first class, I was introduced to the fundamentals of cybersecurity. Here's a summary of what I learned:

---

### 🔐 What Is Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks. These attacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information.

### 🧱 CIA Triad – The Core of Cybersecurity

A major foundation in cybersecurity is the **CIA Triad**:

- **C – Confidentiality:** Protecting information from unauthorized access  
- **I – Integrity:** Ensuring information is not tampered with  
- **A – Availability:** Making sure systems and data are accessible when needed

### 💥 Common Cyber Attacks & Methods

Cyber attackers use different techniques to break into systems. Here are the ones I learned in my first class:

| **Attack Type** | **Description** |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Malware** | Malicious software like viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware |
| **Phishing** | Fake emails or websites that trick users into giving away sensitive info |
| **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)** | Attacker secretly intercepts communication between two parties |
| **Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS)** | Overwhelms a system or server to make it crash or become unavailable |
| **SQL Injection** | Attackers insert malicious SQL queries into input fields to access databases |
| **Zero-Day Attack** | Exploiting unknown vulnerabilities before they are patched |
| **Brute Force Attack** | Repeatedly trying passwords until the correct one is guessed |
| **Social Engineering** | Manipulating people (not systems) to give out confidential info |

### 📊 ISO/IEC 27001 – Security Standard

I also learned about **ISO 27001**, a global standard that helps organizations set up a secure system called **ISMS (Information Security Management System)**.  
It involves:

- Risk assessment
- Security policies
- Access control
- Data protection strategies

Big companies and banks follow ISO 27001 to protect customer data and pass security audits.
